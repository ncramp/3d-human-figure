# 3d-human-figure
I needed a very basic low poly 3D human figure for a project. There is a low poly version and subdivided version. Both in obj. format. 
In Blender the export settings used are:
-write normals
-include UV's
-triangulate faces

Subdivided version has faces with Catmull-Clark, levels view 2
